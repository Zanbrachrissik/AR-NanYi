A simple application for getting an ARKit scene up and running with SceneKit. Click the screen and the model would show up, then you can have a close look at it.

# Requirements

- Xcode 9.x
- iOS 11
- An iOS device with an A9 or better processor (iPhone 6s or superior, iPad Pro, iPad 2017)

# Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the project in Xcode 9.
4. Run the project in a real device with iOS 11. AR can't work in the simulator, so you'll need to configure a team to be able to run your app on a device.
